      "Modern Day Woman", 2018 <BR>

<p>For the Time Capsule project, I wanted to reflect on the major shift in post-war fashion due to Christian Dior’s “The New Look” <BR>and  how the style is still very relevant, focusing on the concept of “Timeless Fashion” and the ideal of a “Modern Day Woman”. <BR>Fashion is a transparent representative of its era. Two years after the war, Christian Dior debuts his first collection, which was a <BR>showstopper. Merely because during wartime women were wearing simple, straight and heavy dresses. They were dressed in structured <BR>attire, merely because they couldn’t afford to do anything else extravagant. For Dior this was an ode to women, a return back to <BR>glamour and 

femininity by accentuating the waist and emphasizing the bust with full skirts and constructed clothing to give the emphasis of the <BR>

hourglass shape. Women were badass and did what they had to do: taking over the civilian workforce and replacing once male-dominated <BR>

occupations. 4 million women working and 350,000 joining the military, which is remarkable. To me this was the start of the modern <BR>day 

women narrative. So for this complete 360 was a breath of fresh air.</p>

<p>Seventy years later, we still see the full skirts and well thought out constructed dresses influenced by the 1950’s. When I saw <BR>

Maison Margiela’s Couture Artisanal A/W 2018 collection, I saw The New Look style intertwined with Margiela’s couture. The <BR>

wide-brimmed garden-style hats made of trash bag material, the clinched waist and accentuated hips on this one particular models’ <BR>

outfit.</p>

<p>For me, it was the perfect mixture of the past and present. The stylized “New Look” mixed with Galliano’s “techno sorbet” color <BR>

palette and interesting choice of recycled materials. Then when I think about what a modern day woman is like today, I think of an <BR>

independent woman who has her priorities straightened and doesn’t let a man define her worth. She isn’t conflicted with her <BR>

self-esteem and does whatever she pleases. In the height of the #MeToo movement and women reclaiming the respect they deserve, <BR>

Margiela’s collection to me screams authenticity and full of vibrant colors.</p>

<p>In the composite I wanted to highlight the contrast that with the lack of colors they used back then. And since the composite is <BR>

supposed to be implanting a surrealistic collage technique, I thought it was only right to use a Dada/Surrealism photomontage style. <BR>

In my composite it’s highly influenced by Hannah Hoch’s style, it has that look of “oh I just cut and pasted the images on there”, <BR>

very avant garde. I didn’t want to do anything way too crazy because I really want the viewer to focus in on the compare and contrast <BR>

of the two outfits simultaneously. I repeated the model a few times to suggest movement. I added a few opposite colored dots on each <BR>

side to give a sense of it being each style being correlated. I wanted the design to look clean and organized personally so I didn’t <BR>

add any opposite colored dots on the models, I felt like it looked too messy. I believe that eyes are unintentionally become a focal <BR>

point, so I added sensors covering the eyes, in order for the viewer to really pay attention to the fashion and add some <BR>

mysteriousness. The background is a lovely shade of pink but also has the phrase repeated in typeface Didot “Modern Day Women”. These <BR>

two outfits to me represented the “Modern Day Women”, but evidently, in different times.</p>
