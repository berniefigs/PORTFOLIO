        <h2>CREATIVE BRIEF</h2> 

Faux-scent called UMBRA. It's a dark & cold scent—ideal for only the most exclusive  <BR>

black-tie events—a poetic touch to a stern, enigmatic character. This launch would  <BR>

include a new label design for the bottle (consider it a special edition) and of course,  <BR> 

a magazine ad spread. <BR> <BR>


<h2>COLOGNE DESIGN</h2> 

Thinking of the definition of umbra, I was thinking how I could play with light and  <BR>

shadow to abstractly interpret the meaning itself. Using the copyright Hawthorne provided <BR>

 me, "Catch your own shadow' not too opaque, just a glimpse of it, quite mysterious. <BR> 

 That line was originally for the magazine spread, but I decided to include it in the  <BR>

 cologne design because I felt like it captured what the faux-scent umbra was all about. <BR> <BR>


<h2>MAGAZINE AD</h2> 
The design intent here was to create a magazine spread to exude the dark, scent with the  <BR>

poetic touch. I felt a monochromatic palette was only right with tonal range. The bottle <BR> 

was quite minimalistic, so I wanted the magazine spread to add delight by adding flowers  <BR>

daintily framing the cologne. There's a lot of white negative space to balance the  <BR>

darkness of the cologne, but also not to take away its shine.
