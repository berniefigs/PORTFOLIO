            </h2>
            <h3>
                 Freelance OG Mami Nutrition, 2020 <br>
            </h3>
      <p>
  My client Vianca, is a health coach + nutritionist, who helps people get healthy via
  weight loss, muscle gains or overall wellness. This business endeavor is quite fresh, 
  she asked me to design her logo and overall brand identity for her company called 
  Organic Mami Nutrition. Her criteria was that she wants the brand to exude weirdness 
  and quirkiness with a flare of professional intent. Off the bat, she was afraid the 
  company name was a bit too lengthy to include in the logo. I suggested we shorten 
  ‘Organic’ to ‘OG’ for the sake of composition, which rolled off the tongue nicely. 
  She approved my idea, and I got to designing.
      </p>
      <p>
  Vianca wanted the logo to be an avocado. She sent me a drawing of this avocado she 
  was obsessed with. It was drawn very scribbly, which is why she enjoyed it so much. 
  With that in mind I started to put together a moodboard. My mind instantly knew Pop 
  Art would be a source of inspiration. When designing for new clients, I like to have 
  a range of options, from playing it safe to doing the most. It gives the client an  
  idea of how far I can take an idea (if need be) and to visually grasp which aesthetic 
  embodies their brand successfully. I had an array of avocado iterations that could be
  paired with three different colorful polka dot backdrops. When I presented the design 
  mockups to the client, she told me how glad she was that I understood her creative 
  vision. After reviewing the logo designs, she decides that she wants her brand to 
  lean towards a minimalist aesthetic. Vianca decided to go with just an avocado, 
  without any backdrop. 
    </p>
    <p> 
  In the presentation I sent her of the mockups, I added some examples of the avocado
  logo paired with the company name in various compositions. Vianca said she liked how the  company name slightly overlapped on top of the avocado off to the side, so I utilized 
  that composition for the final logo design. The last thing on the todo list was to narrow 
  down the five chosen typefaces. The serif font was immediately disqualified, it would be
  too clashing with the avocado. We needed a sans-serif that showed subtle personality, but 
  not too boring. For the chosen typeface, we went with Riposte, a neo-grotesque typeface  inspired by midcentury fonts, mixed with contemporary features from the Good Type Foundry,  based in Oslo, Norway in the weight Heavy.

                 Song Used: Impossible by Travis Scott
               </h3>

            <p>For my project I chose to re-tell a narrative within a song. I choose Impossible, by Travis Scott, off his album Rodeo. It’s absolutely one of my all time favorites. I decided to go with a song instead of retelling a normal story/event because I knew I wanted to create an interesting composition and music had the perfect element of abstraction for me to experiment with. (I was really inspired by the last project where we had to make soundscapes).  As the tenth track off of Travis Scott’s debut album Rodeo, “Impossible” seems to be about Travis lamenting about himself being trapped with an unloving someone. In this song, he describes the pain that comes with it, and how he wishes he could let loose from it. Although this isn’t my originally project, my thumb drive got lost in the mail so I had to make the quick new animation. To make a cohesive video I tried to be consistent with the effects I used and staying within the color palette. (Black, white, lime green). To set a sad tone, I went with a darker color scheme and using black and white images. The stop motion’s aesthetic is very dada and I really try to get the viewer in a trance, especially with the night drive scenes on the highway of Downtown LA.</p>

                 Time Project "MODERN DAY WOMAN", 2018 <br>
                 Digital Photomontage
            </h3>
            <p>For the Time Capsule project, I wanted to reflect on the major shift in post-war fashion due to Christian Dior’s “The New Look”
and how the style is still very relevant, focusing on the concept of “Timeless Fashion” and the ideal of a “Modern Day Woman”.
Fashion is a transparent representative of its era. Two years after the war, Christian Dior debuts his first collection, which was a
showstopper. Merely because during wartime women were wearing simple, straight and heavy dresses. They were dressed in structured
attire, merely because they couldn’t afford to do anything else extravagant. For Dior this was an ode to women, a return back to
glamour and femininity by accentuating the waist and emphasizing the bust with full skirts and constructed clothing to give the emphasis of the
hourglass shape. Women were badass and did what they had to do: taking over the civilian workforce and replacing once male-dominated
occupations. 4 million women working and 350,000 joining the military, which is remarkable. To me this was the start of the modern
day women narrative. So for this complete 360 was a breath of fresh air.</p>

<p>Seventy years later, we still see the full skirts and well thought out constructed dresses influenced by the 1950’s. When I saw
Maison Margiela’s Couture Artisanal A/W 2018 collection, I saw The New Look style intertwined with Margiela’s couture. The
wide-brimmed garden-style hats made of trash bag material, the clinched waist and accentuated hips on this one particular models’
outfit.</p>

<p>For me, it was the perfect mixture of the past and present. The stylized “New Look” mixed with Galliano’s “techno sorbet” color
palette and interesting choice of recycled materials. Then when I think about what a modern day woman is like today, I think of an
independent woman who has her priorities straightened and doesn’t let a man define her worth. She isn’t conflicted with her
self-esteem and does whatever she pleases. In the height of the #MeToo movement and women reclaiming the respect they deserve,
Margiela’s collection to me screams authenticity and full of vibrant colors.</p>

<p>In the composite I wanted to highlight the contrast that with the lack of colors they used back then. And since the composite is
supposed to be implanting a surrealistic collage technique, I thought it was only right to use a Dada/Surrealism photomontage style.
In my composite it’s highly influenced by Hannah Hoch’s style, it has that look of “oh I just cut and pasted the images on there”,
very avant garde. I didn’t want to do anything way too crazy because I really want the viewer to focus in on the compare and contrast
of the two outfits simultaneously. I repeated the model a few times to suggest movement. I added a few opposite colored dots on each
side to give a sense of it being each style being correlated. I wanted the design to look clean and organized personally so I didn’t
add any opposite colored dots on the models, I felt like it looked too messy. I believe that eyes are unintentionally become a focal
point, so I added sensors covering the eyes, in order for the viewer to really pay attention to the fashion and add some
mysteriousness. The background is a lovely shade of pink but also has the phrase repeated in typeface Didot “Modern Day Women”. These
two outfits to me represented the “Modern Day Women”, but evidently, in different times.</p>

            <p>For my Core Interaction Lab course, we had to create a phone screensaver. So I chose to transition Alber's Homage to Squares paintings because I felt like it would be very calming and get the viewer in a trance. </p>

            <p>This portrait is currently hanging in their salon. The art direction I was going for was Old Hollywood Glam. I did the makeup on the model and edited the photos.</p>
