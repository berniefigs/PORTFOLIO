            </h2>
            <h3>
                 Freelance OG Mami Nutrition, 2020 <br>
            </h3>
                  <p>
              My client Vianca, is a health coach + nutritionist, who helps people get healthy via
              weight loss, muscle gains or overall wellness. This business endeavor is quite fresh, 
              she asked me to design her logo and overall brand identity for her company called 
              Organic Mami Nutrition. Her criteria was that she wants the brand to exude weirdness 
              and quirkiness with a flare of professional intent. Off the bat, she was afraid the 
              company name was a bit too lengthy to include in the logo. I suggested we shorten 
              ‘Organic’ to ‘OG’ for the sake of composition, which rolled off the tongue nicely. 
              She approved my idea, and I got to designing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
              Vianca wanted the logo to be an avocado. She sent me a drawing of this avocado she 
              was obsessed with. It was drawn very scribbly, which is why she enjoyed it so much. 
              With that in mind I started to put together a moodboard. My mind instantly knew Pop 
              Art would be a source of inspiration. When designing for new clients, I like to have 
              a range of options, from playing it safe to doing the most. It gives the client an  
              idea of how far I can take an idea (if need be) and to visually grasp which aesthetic 
              embodies their brand successfully. I had an array of avocado iterations that could be
              paired with three different colorful polka dot backdrops. When I presented the design 
              mockups to the client, she told me how glad she was that I understood her creative 
              vision. After reviewing the logo designs, she decides that she wants her brand to 
              lean towards a minimalist aesthetic. Vianca decided to go with just an avocado, 
              without any backdrop. 
                </p>
                <p> 
              In the presentation I sent her of the mockups, I added some examples of the avocado
              logo paired with the company name in various compositions. Vianca said she liked how the 
              company name slightly overlapped on top of the avocado off to the side, so I utilized 
              that composition for the final logo design. The last thing on the todo list was to narrow 
              down the five chosen typefaces. The serif font was immediately disqualified, it would be
              too clashing with the avocado. We needed a sans-serif that showed subtle personality, but 
              not too boring. For the chosen typeface, we went with Riposte, a neo-grotesque typeface 
              inspired by midcentury fonts, mixed with contemporary features from the Good Type Foundry,
              based in Oslo, Norway in the weight Heavy.

            @ARealFairy, my client Julia, wanted a customized price sheet and testimonial sheet to display on her twitter account, she uses the platform to get in touch with her clients and conduct her business. Her two main criteria for the design was for it to have a fairy aesthetic and to match the twitter header on her profile (shown below). I felt like a colorful, hypnotic circular gradient for the background was perfect to exude spirituality and a sense of calmness.

            <p> For my final project for this course, the narrative I choose to delve into research to raise awarewareness of the falisities of social media. This topic screams importance to me, due to the fact that social media is heavily unregulated. A black hole of fake news and distorted realities. I decided to design and develop an online magazine instead of a physical one, in terms of accessiblity to any user who can access the inters of web. I've done research and written articles on the pitfalls of social media, selfie dysmorhia, self-objectication and psychological distress. There are also authentic interviews I conducted with people I'm rather close with, asking difficult questions about social media with a highly pessimistic tone within the questions.

                 Creative Computing Project, 2018 <br>
                 Front-End Coding + Designed by Me
            </h3>
            <p> For my Creative Computing course, we had to create a dynamic, digital type specimen (i.e. a web page) for an actual typeface in the spirit of contemporary type foundries. I decided to design a type specimen Lo-Res, a family is synthesis of pixelated designs, including Emigre’s earlier coarse resolution fonts, as well as bitmap representations of Base 9. This typeface also offer technical improvements, including a more complete character set, more consistent character shapes among styles and weights, as well as improved alignment among the various resolutions.
            </p> 

            <p> At the time, I was really obsessed with this song, 2AM by Coldhart. So I wanted to base the aesthetic for this project around the song. The design problem I attempted to solve was how could I transfer the mood/tone of the song into a visual medium that also cohesively ties with the typeface.
            </p>
            <p> First, I began designing a static mockup in Adobe Illustrator, figuring out how I wanted the layout and structure of the website to be. The tone of 2AM is sad and dark, the feeling of nostalgia of an old lover. I find that reminiscing on the past can be a painful experience, not living in the moment, wishing things were different. That’s why I decided on fairly dark color palette: black, white and neon lime green. I sourced some images that were intentionally ornamental, adding visual depth to the affect I wanted to exude. The roses and the half portrait of the girl in the ski mask are my own photography. I pixelated and turned all the images to black and white, so the colors of the images wouldn’t be too distracting and due to the fact I was strictly utilizing the color palette as a design constraint. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Although I was creating an aesthetic for the type specimen highly inspired by 2AM, I didn’t want to visually communicate the narrative of missing a past lover. To show off the typeface as well as to prose some existential questions in regards to objective experience of reality, I have repeated lines of “WHAT WOULD DO YOU IF WEREN’T AFRAID?”, “MAYBE I’VE ALWAYS BEEN MORE COMFORTABLE IN CHAOS” and lastly, “THIS ISN’T REAL”. I didn’t want the website to be completely static, so added some fun CSS animations to add some delight to counteract the dark tone of the aesthetic.

            <p>
            The Creative Design Intern position needed a creative with a strong interest in interactive marketing, tech and creative to work alongside the team. A mix of digital creative, live event activations and interactive experiences.
          </p>

            <p>
            For the final round of intern candidates, they gave me a test assignment to collectively gauge my creativity, design ability and overall understanding of the Coffee Labs and all that they encompass. They wanted me to design a 2019 Holiday card for Coffee Labs that they would send out to clients. Here is the example they provided that they have sent out to clients in the past, featuring a snowman getting biometrically scanned to express holiday joy. The goal of the project was to design a similar concept with some element unique to Coffee Labs to help remind the client of the work they do + their unique approach to brand marketing and tech activations.
            </p>

            <p>
            While browsing through Coffee Lab’s portfolio, I was impressed by the immersive, experiential experiences they were able to create through VR + AR for their clients. So the tone for the holiday card I wanted to exude was elegant sleekness. I choose togo with a dark grayish blue color palette with white for a nice contrast. I used a Monospace typeface to give the holiday card a modern feel, as most programming softwares utilize Monospaced typefaces. The bulb ornament begins getting biometrically scanned, and from the user’s perspective the holiday card resembles a computer monitor processes the object, measuring the festive emotions one feels during the holidays- jolly, happy and joyfulness. The GIF loops seamlessly. Concept and designed by me in After Effects.

            </h3>
            <p>For the Parson’s IT department, I designed a series of creative content for their social media platforms- specifically Twitter and Instagram, digital posters for the digital easels showcased across campus and also ran their social media platforms + wrote articles for the Parsons’ IT blog, called Techtalk. This was my first taste working with a grounded design brand identity and I had to figure out the delicious balance between my storytelling within design and within the constraints of Parsons’ aesthetic. </p>

            <p>For Advanced Typography, one of the final projects entailed going to the MoMA or PS-1 and design promotional materials: a series of posters, brochure—for the one of the currents exhibition. I decided to create promo materials for the Constantin Brancusi Sculpture. I enjoy his work very much so and respect his craftsmanship, and appreciate how ahead of his time he was. </p>

            <p>For Advanced Typography, one of the final projects was to design Franz Kafka’s The Metamorphosis. I had to consider what the message of the story, and how to translate it into visual form. We had to design the book into three parts- every part would exude a different graphic design stylistic preference. The first part was Traditional, the second part was Modern/Bauhaus and the last part was Post-Modernism.</p>

            <p>For the second and third parts, we started developing spoiler pages, pages that were expressive text to add delight and an element of surprise to the book.</p>

                 Song Used: Impossible by Travis Scott
               </h3>

            <p>For my project I chose to re-tell a narrative within a song. I choose Impossible, by Travis Scott, off his album Rodeo. It’s absolutely one of my all time favorites. I decided to go with a song instead of retelling a normal story/event because I knew I wanted to create an interesting composition and music had the perfect element of abstraction for me to experiment with. (I was really inspired by the last project where we had to make soundscapes).  As the tenth track off of Travis Scott’s debut album Rodeo, “Impossible” seems to be about Travis lamenting about himself being trapped with an unloving someone. In this song, he describes the pain that comes with it, and how he wishes he could let loose from it. Although this isn’t my originally project, my thumb drive got lost in the mail so I had to make the quick new animation. To make a cohesive video I tried to be consistent with the effects I used and staying within the color palette. (Black, white, lime green). To set a sad tone, I went with a darker color scheme and using black and white images. The stop motion’s aesthetic is very dada and I really try to get the viewer in a trance, especially with the night drive scenes on the highway of Downtown LA.</p>

                 Digital Photomontage
            </h3>
            <p>For the Time Capsule project, I wanted to reflect on the major shift in post-war fashion due to Christian Dior’s “The New Look” and how the style is still very relevant, focusing on the concept of “Timeless Fashion” and the ideal of a “Modern Day Woman”. Fashion is a transparent representative of its era. Two years after the war, Christian Dior debuts his first collection, which was a showstopper. Merely because during wartime women were wearing simple, straight and heavy dresses. They were dressed in structured attire, merely because they couldn’t afford to do anything else extravagant. For Dior this was an ode to women, a return back to glamour and femininity by accentuating the waist and emphasizing the bust with full skirts and constructed clothing to give the emphasis of the hourglass shape. Women were badass and did what they had to do: taking over the civilian workforce and replacing once male-dominated occupations. 4 million women working and 350,000 joining the military, which is remarkable. To me this was the start of the modern day women narrative. So for this complete 360 was a breath of fresh air.</p>

            <p>Seventy years later, we still see the full skirts and well thought out constructed dresses influenced by the 1950’s. When I saw Maison Margiela’s Couture Artisanal A/W 2018 collection, I saw The New Look style intertwined with Margiela’s couture. The wide-brimmed garden-style hats made of trash bag material, the clinched waist and accentuated hips on this one particular models’ outfit.</p>

            <p>For me, it was the perfect mixture of the past and present. The stylized “New Look” mixed with Galliano’s “techno sorbet” color palette and interesting choice of recycled materials. Then when I think about what a modern day woman is like today, I think of an independent woman who has her priorities straightened and doesn’t let a man define her worth. She isn’t conflicted with her self-esteem and does whatever she pleases. In the height of the #MeToo movement and women reclaiming the respect they deserve, Margiela’s collection to me screams authenticity and full of vibrant colors.</p>

            <p>In the composite I wanted to highlight the contrast that with the lack of colors they used back then. And since the composite is supposed to be implanting a surrealistic collage technique, I thought it was only right to use a Dada/Surrealism photomontage style. In my composite it’s highly influenced by Hannah Hoch’s style, it has that look of “oh I just cut and pasted the images on there”, very avant garde. I didn’t want to do anything way too crazy because I really want the viewer to focus in on the compare and contrast of the two outfits simultaneously. I repeated the model a few times to suggest movement. I added a few opposite colored dots on each side to give a sense of it being each style being correlated. I wanted the design to look clean and organized personally so I didn’t add any opposite colored dots on the models, I felt like it looked too messy. I believe that eyes are unintentionally become a focal point, so I added sensors covering the eyes, in order for the viewer to really pay attention to the fashion and add some mysteriousness. The background is a lovely shade of pink but also has the phrase repeated in typeface Didot “Modern Day Women”. These two outfits to me represented the “Modern Day Women”, but evidently, in different times.</p>
