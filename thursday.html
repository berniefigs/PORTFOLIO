My remake of the album "Thursday" by The Weeknd for my Typography class. In this mixtape, he <br>

tells a tale about a drug invested love story with a twisted gal named Valerie. Thursday is the only <br>


day he will love her. So the front cover (on the right) is Thursday, she cheery and the colors are <br>


vibrant. On the left side, it's every other day of the week, she is a neurotic, a druggie, and very sad. <br>


The colors are very dark and grim and she looks like hell. To give it an intimate feeling I hand wrote <br>


some of the lyrics all over the portrait. <br><br>

For the lyric poster, I wanted to create a twisty and dark romantic vibe. To create the background of this poster, I put 
 <br>
red paint on my lips and kissed a sheet of paper a bunch of times, scanned it in and edited it to get 
 <br>
this interesting smokey, dark rorschach of kisses. Then again to get that intimate aspect I hand 
 <br>
wrote the lyrics in cursive and scanned it in, and laid it all out in Illustrator.
